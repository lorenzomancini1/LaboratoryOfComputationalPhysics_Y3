    "A mathematical function $f(x)$ is well-conditioned if $f(x+\\epsilon)\\simeq f(x)$ for all small perturbations $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the functionf(x) is **well-conditioned** if the solution varies gradually as problem varies. For a well-conditinoed function, all small perutbations have small effects. However, a poorly-conditioned problem only needs some small perturbations to have large effects. For example, inverting a nearly singluar matrix is a poorly conditioned problem.\n",

    "A numerical algorithm $g(x)$ is numerically-stable if $g(x)\\simeq f(x′)$ for some $x′\\simeq x$. Note that stability is a property that relates the algorithm $g(x)$ to the problem $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the algorithm $g(x)$ is **numerically stable** if it gives nearly the right answer to nearly the right question. Numerically unstable algorithms tend to amplify approximation errors due to computer arithmetic over time. If we used an infitinte precision numerical system, stable and unstable alorithms would have the same accuracy. However, as we have seen (e.g. variance calculation), when using floating point numbers, algebrically equivaelent algorithms can give different results.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In most of the cases, the solution to stability issues is properly redefying the function as in the example above with the likelihood. More examples follow  "
