    "That is, the algorithm $g(x)$ is **numerically stable** if it gives nearly the right answer to nearly the right question. Numerically unstable algorithms tend to amplify approximation errors due to computer arithmetic over time. If we used an infitinte precision numerical system, stable and unstable alorithms would have the same accuracy. However, as we have seen (e.g. variance calculation), when using floating point numbers, algebrically equivaelent algorithms can give different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we need both a well-conditinoed problem and nuerical stabilty of the algorihtm to reliably accurate answers. In this case, we can be sure that $g(x)\\simeq f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the cases, the solution to stability issues is properly redefying the function as in the example above with the likelihood. More examples follow  "
